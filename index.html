            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>
              I am a Year 2 Data Science and Analytics student enrolled in the National University of Singapore.

              <br><br> Since young, I have always been fascinated with Mathematics and Computers. The interplay between numbers, algorithms and problem-solving has been the guiding force in shaping my academic pursuits, leading me to where I am today. Studying minors in Computer Science and Economics, I aim to integrate the rigour of programming and the principles of economics to create a multidisciplinary approach to tackle complex data-driven challenges.

              <br><br> With knowledge of Python, R and SQL, I am eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. Through these experiences, I aim to develop myself further in data analysis and problem-solving, even if it may be just a little.

              <br><br> Feel free to contact me if you would like a quick chat! :D
