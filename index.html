            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>
              Hi there! I am currently a Year 2 Data Science and Analytics student enrolled in the National University of Singapore.
              
              Since young, I have always been fascinated with Mathematics and Computers. The interplay between numbers, algorithms and problem-solving has been the guiding force in shaping my academic pursuits, leading me to where I am today. Having minors in Computer Science and Economics, I aim to integrate the rigour of programming and the principles of economics to create a multidisciplinary approach to tackle complex data-driven challenges.
             
              With knowledge of Python, R and SQL, I am eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to meaningful projects.

              Feel free to contact me if you would like a quick chat! :D
